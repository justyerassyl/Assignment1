        <td style="width:600px">The BMW X5 is a mid-size luxury, 
            rear-wheel drive SUV produced by BMW. The X5 
            made its debut in 1999. It was BMW's first SUV and 
            it also featured all-wheel drive and was available with 
            either manual or automatic transmission. In 2006, the second 
            generation X5 was launched, known internally as the E70.
            BMW branded the X5 as a Sport Activity Vehicle (SAV) rather than 
            an SUV, to emphasize its on-road ability despite its size. Like 
            the Lexus RX 300, the X5 heralded the shift from light truck-based 
            body-on-frame SUVs to crossovers underpinned by unibody car platforms 
            that would come to fruition in the late 2000s. Among German luxury 
            automakers, while the Mercedes-Benz M-Class had beaten the X5 to 
            the market by a year, the X5 was the first to use a unibody chassis 
            whereas the M-Class used a light truck platform until its second
             generation. While the Lexus RX is based on the Toyota Camry mass 
             market sedan, the X5 shares its underpinnings with the BMW 5 Series 
             performance luxury sedan.</td>

        <td style="width:600px">The Porsche Cayenne is a mid-size luxury crossover sport utility vehicle produced by the 
            German manufacturer Porsche since 2002, with North American sales beginning in 2003. It is the first V8-engined 
            vehicle built by Porsche since 1995, when the Porsche 928 was discontinued. It is also Porsche's first off-road variant 
            vehicle 
            since its Super and Junior tractors of the 1950s, and the first Porsche with four doors. Since 2008, all engines have 
            featured direct injection technology.
            The second-generation Cayenne (Type 92A) was unveiled at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show in March following an online reveal. 
            The Cayenne shares its platform, body frame, doors and electronics with the similar Volkswagen Touareg and Audi Q7. 
            The second generation received a facelift in 2014 with minor external changes, and introduced a new plug-in E-Hybrid 
            version, with its public launch at the Paris Motor Show.
